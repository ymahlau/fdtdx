class Material(ExtendedTreeClass):
    """
    Represents an electromagnetic material with specific electrical and magnetic properties.

    This class stores the fundamental electromagnetic properties of a material for use
    in electromagnetic simulations.

    Attributes:
        permittivity: The relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of the material,
            which describes how the electric field is affected by the material.
        permeability: The relative permeability of the material, which
            describes how the magnetic field is affected by the material.
        conductivity: The electrical conductivity of the material in siemens
            per meter (S/m), which describes how easily electric current can flow through it.

    Args:
        permittivity: The relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of the material,
            which describes how the electric field is affected by the material. Higher values
            indicate greater electric polarization in response to an applied electric field.

        permeability: The relative permeability of the material, which
            describes how the magnetic field is affected by the material. Higher values
            indicate greater magnetic response to an applied magnetic field.
            Defaults to 1.0 (non-magnetic material).

        conductivity: The electrical conductivity of the material in siemens
            per meter (S/m), which describes how easily electric current can flow through it.
            Higher values indicate materials that conduct electricity more easily.
            Defaults to 0.0 (perfect insulator).
